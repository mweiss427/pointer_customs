<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I started by going to school for engineering and then decided to go into the trades. I have been in the trades for 10 years, now I've gone off on my own and started my own business. I have a passion for building and creating things. I love to see the finished product and the satisfaction of a job well done.
